## 📅 Weekly Problem Sets

Here are the problem sets for each week of PILOT learning.
- The problem sets will be updated before Monday each week, it is consisted of a problem set combined with (sometimes) additional materials, accompanied by a passcode protected solution manual.
  - We might update problem sets and solution manuals due to minor typos, so please always refresh for the latest version.
  - The solution is passcode protected to encourage attendance to PILOT sessions, ask your PILOT leader while you are attending the session for more information.
  - During the weeks when a quiz is given, the solution manual will not have a passcode for equality among all PILOT sessions that week.

| ⤴️ Attention on Different Contents |
|:------------|
|For this semesters, since different sections are covering different materials, there will be problems designed specifically for one section but not the other.<br> In general, the questions labeled with **S** are the questions designated for Series Solutions for Second Order ODEs (Section 01-03) and the questions labeled with **L** are the questions designated for Laplace Transformation (Section 04-06).|

- Additional resources would be tagged or linked in the resources' column.
  - Also check out the [Resources](/FA25/resources.html#important-documents) for additional notes and practices.

## 📑 Review Information

For the in-class assessments, we will prepare corresponding review resources.
- We will provide a practice set, its solutions, and a slide deck of related materials.
    - If you wish to time the practice sets, each problem shall take approximately 12.5 to 15 minutes.
- The review session information will be updated approximately a week before the assessment. As of right now, we are sure to give review sessions before the final exam, but we have not decided if we shall plan quiz reviews.
